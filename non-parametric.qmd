It is necessary to verify some aspects of the data in order to check the correlation between the variables.

![](data/0_jaBjgiUZuTEydu1D.webp){fig-align="center"}

| Aspect                   | **Pearson**                       | **Spearman**                                               | **Kendall**                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Type of relationship** | Linear                            | Monotonic (any shape)                                      | Monotonic (any shape)                           |
| **Data assumptions**     | Continuous, normal, no outliers   | Ordinal or continuous, any distribution, fewer assumptions | Ordinal or continuous, handles tied ranks well  |
| **Effect of outliers**   | Sensitive to outliers             | Less sensitive                                             | Least sensitive                                 |
| **Range**                | -1 to 1                           | -1 to 1                                                    | -1 to 1                                         |
| **Use case**             | Linear relationships, normal data | Non-linear, monotonic relationships, or ordinal data       | Small datasets, ordinal data, or data with ties |

We can use the same function in R for all these correlations. In the function `cor.test()`, we just need to change the parameter `method` to `"pearson"`, `"spearman"` or `"kendall"`.

#### Example

```         
cor.test(formula = ~ VARIABLE_1 + VARIABLE_2, data = DATASET, method = "pearson")
cor.test(formula = ~ VARIABLE_1 + VARIABLE_2, data = DATASET, method = "kendall")
cor.test(formula = ~ VARIABLE_1 + VARIABLE_2, data = DATASET, method = "spearman")
```

```{r}
# get the data
df <- read.csv("data/green.csv")
```

### Pearson's correlation for site DS

```{r}
# separate the sites
df_siteDS <- subset(df, SITE == "DS")
# get the correlation
cor.test(formula = ~ TOTMASS + BURROWS, data = df_siteDS, method = "pearson")
```

## Interpretation

**Moderate Positive Correlation**: The Pearson correlation coefficient of approximately 0.3917 indicates a moderate positive correlation between `TOTMASS` and `BURROWS`, suggesting that as one variable increases, the other tends to increase as well.

**Not Statistically Significant**: The p-value of 0.3372 indicates that this correlation is not statistically significant, meaning that it could easily arise due to random chance in this sample.

**Confidence Interval**: The confidence interval ranging from -0.4323 to 0.8592 includes zero, reinforcing the idea that there is insufficient evidence to conclude a true correlation exists in the population.
:::

### Spearman's correlation for site DS

This correlation uses the Greek letter $\rho$ (Rho).

```{r}
# separate the sites
df_siteDS <- subset(df, SITE == "DS")
# get the correlation
cor.test(formula = ~ TOTMASS + BURROWS, data = df_siteDS, method = "spearman")
```

::: callout-note
## Interpretation

**Weak Correlation**: The correlation coefficient (rho = 0.1677) suggests a weak positive correlation between `TOTMASS` and `BURROWS`.

**Not Significant**: The high p-value (0.6915) indicates that this weak correlation is not statistically significant, meaning that there's no strong evidence of a monotonic relationship between the variables in the sample.

**Ties in Data**: The presence of ties in the data affects the precision of the p-value calculation, but it does not change the interpretation that the relationship between `TOTMASS` and `BURROWS` is likely weak and non-significant in this case.
:::

### Kendall's correlation for site DS

This correlation uses the Greek letter $\tau$ (tau).

```{r}
# separate the sites
df_siteDS <- subset(df, SITE == "DS")
# get the correlation
cor.test(formula = ~ TOTMASS + BURROWS, data = df_siteDS, method = "kendall")
```

::: callout-note
## Interpretation

**Very Weak Correlation**: The tau value (0.03637) indicates a very weak positive correlation, suggesting that `TOTMASS` and `BURROWS` do not have a meaningful monotonic relationship.

**Not Significant**: The high p-value (0.9008) shows that the weak correlation is not statistically significant, leading to the conclusion that you cannot reject the null hypothesis that the true Kendall correlation is zero.

**Ties in Data**: As with the Spearman correlation, the presence of ties impacts the precision of the p-value calculation, but the interpretation remains consistent: the relationship between `TOTMASS` and `BURROWS` is weak and not significant.
